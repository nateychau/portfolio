      bullets: ['Interviews with both experienced gym-goers and gym novices revealed that many who turned it into a habit had some sort of experienced mentor that introduced them to working out. Through a process of field observations, user interviews and need finding, and design exercises (such as affinity diagrams and user personas), our team created the Gym Buddies program. Participants sign up as either a mentor or mentee, and get paired to their own mentor/mentee based on scheduling and other preferences. Both parties receive a stamp card, which they can fill out as they visit the gym together. Stamps are exchanged for rewards such as UCSD merchandise or fitness class credits. \nFor more information, check out the video on the right, or have a peek at our full 59-page paper.'],
