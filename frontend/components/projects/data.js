    "We used Twitter's API to record tweets with certain keywords or hashtags (ie 'KD', 'Giannis', 'Greek Freak', etc), and the Tweepy API to analyze the sentiment of these tweets", 
    "Data cleaning and visualizations were done with Python", "Overall, we saw a weak relationship between the sentiment value of tweet's about a basketball player and the results of their games, though there are factors that may have skewed our results (which are discussed in the paper)"],
